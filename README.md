# Machine-Learning-Association-Rule-Analysis
Association Rule Analysis using Vaccine Data. compare the results of apriori and fpgrowth. using the Association rule function with the metric confidence. from the analysis, we can see that most of the younger age group got the PFIZER vaccine which is true as the PFIZER vaccine was the first vaccine approved for the younger age group.
 Data used from CDS from 1990-2022 (cant upload about 100 csv data files) but I have trimmed the data to dataset file which cant be uplaoded either because it is too big (2.5GB)
